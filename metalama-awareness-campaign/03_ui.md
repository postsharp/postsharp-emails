Hi {{firstName}},

This is **{{sendingAccountFirstName}}** from Metalama. In my previous emails, I showed how Metalama can help you reduce boilerplate code for DevOps concerns like logging and caching. Today, I’d like to show you how Metalama can simplify common front-end challenges: think observability (`INotifyPropertyChanged`), undo/redo, change tracking, and WPF dependency properties and commands.

## INotifyPropertyChanged

If you’re building a desktop or mobile app—or even a web app with client-side Blazor—you’re probably familiar with the `INotifyPropertyChanged` interface. While it looks simple, implementing it by hand quickly becomes tedious and error-prone as your models grow in complexity.

Enter the `[Observable]` aspect from the open-source [Metalama.Patterns.Observability](https://doc.metalama.net/patterns/observability?mtm_campaign=awareness&mtm_source=instantly&mtm_kwd=email3) package.

```csharp
[Observable]
public class Person
```

This aspect takes care of the `INotifyPropertyChanged` implementation for you, supporting a wide range of scenarios:

- **Automatic properties:**

    ```csharp
    public string? FirstName { get; set; }
    ```

- **Properties depending on other properties or fields:**

    ```csharp
    public string FullName => $"{this.FirstName} {this._lastName}";
    ```

- **Properties depending on child objects:**

    ```csharp
    public string FullName => $"{this.Person.FirstName} {this.Person.LastName}";
    ```

- **Properties depending on base type properties.**

Think about how much repetitive code you’d need to write (and maintain) for these scenarios—and how much you save with Metalama! To see the difference, [check out the diff](https://doc.metalama.net/patterns/observability/standard-cases?mtm_campaign=awareness&mtm_source=instantly&mtm_kwd=email3).

It’s not just about saving time. It’s about reliability. Ever shipped a bug because you forgot to call `OnPropertyChanged`? With `[Observable]`, dependency discovery is fully automatic, so those bugs are a thing of the past.

Read more about `[Observable]` in our [documentation](https://doc.metalama.net/patterns/observability?mtm_campaign=awareness&mtm_source=instantly&mtm_kwd=email3).

## Change Tracking

A common UI requirement is to enable the **Ok** button only when something has changed. Traditionally, this means maintaining an `IsDirty` flag and updating it everywhere—a recipe for repetitive code and mistakes.

With Metalama, you can eliminate this boilerplate entirely. Check out our [Change Tracking](https://metalama.net/applications/change-tracking?mtm_campaign=awareness&mtm_source=instantly&mtm_kwd=email3) example to see how.

## Undo/Redo with Memento

Undo/redo is a must-have feature for any modern UI. The classic way to implement this is with the Memento pattern, but writing all that boilerplate by hand is no fun.

```csharp
[Memento]
public sealed partial class Fish
{
    public string? Name { get; set; }
    public string? Species { get; set; }
    public DateTime DateAdded { get; set; }
}
```

Metalama generates all the plumbing for you:

```csharp
public partial class Fish : IMementoable
{
  public void RestoreMemento(IMemento memento)
  {
    var typedMemento = (Memento) memento;
    this.Name = typedMemento.Name;
    this.Species = typedMemento.Species;
    this.DateAdded = typedMemento.DateAdded;
  }

  public IMemento SaveToMemento()
   => new Memento(this);

  private class Memento: IMemento
  {
    public Memento(Fish originator)
    {
      this.Originator = originator;
      this.Name = originator.Name;
      this.Species = originator.Species;
      this.DateAdded = originator.DateAdded;
    }

    public string? Name { get; }
    public string? Species { get; }
    public DateTime DateAdded { get; }
    public IMementoable? Originator { get; }
  }
}
```

As you can see, the generated code is much longer than your original model. With Metalama, all that’s replaced by a single attribute.

## WPF Commands and Dependency Properties

Implementing commands and dependency properties in WPF is notoriously repetitive. Metalama makes it effortless. Here’s a Counter control with a dependency property and a command:

```csharp
public partial class CounterControl : UserControl
{
    // A dependency property with an initial value.
    [DependencyProperty]
    [Range( 0, 10 )]
    public int Count { get; set; } = 0;

    // Command to increment the counter.
    [Command]
    public void ExecuteIncrement()
    {
        this.Count++;
    }
}
```

That’s it—no more boilerplate. You can learn more about WPF commands and dependency properties on our website.

## Conclusion

UI programming should be creative and enjoyable—not bogged down by repetitive code. Metalama helps you focus on what matters by generating robust, idiomatic code behind the scenes, keeping your source clean and maintainable.
