Hi {{firstName}},

This is **{{sendingAccountFirstName}}** from Metalama. Last year, I reached out to share how Metalama can help you reduce boilerplate code and prevent architecture erosion through advanced code generation and verification.

I'm excited to share some fantastic news: **Metalama is now open source!** Check out the [complete announcement](https://metalama.net/blog/metalama-open-source?mtm_campaign=awareness&mtm_source=instantly&mtm_kwd=emailx1) from our founder for details.

You can now take advantage of our complete [code generation](https://metalama.net/features/code-generation?mtm_campaign=awareness&mtm_source=instantly&mtm_kwd=emailx1) and [aspect-oriented programming](https://metalama.net/applications/aspect-oriented-programming?mtm_campaign=awareness&mtm_source=instantly&mtm_kwd=emailx1) capabilities entirely for free, under the MIT license.

You might be wondering how we plan to ensure the sustainability of the project. To support ongoing development, a few features remain proprietary:

- [Architecture verification](https://metalama.net/applications/architecture-verification?mtm_campaign=awareness&mtm_source=instantly&mtm_kwd=emailx1)
- [Code fix toolkit](https://metalama.net/features/code-fixes?mtm_campaign=awareness&mtm_source=instantly&mtm_kwd=emailx1)
- [Visual Studio extension for Metalama](https://metalama.net/features/tooling?mtm_campaign=awareness&mtm_source=instantly&mtm_kwd=emailx1)

But there’s more good news: even though it remains proprietary, **Visual Studio Tools for Metalama are now available for free** to individuals, non-commercial users, and companies with up to three users under the Metalama Community Edition.

Now, there’s truly no excuse to keep writing repetitive code!

[Get started with Metalama today](https://metalama.net/get?mtm_campaign=awareness&mtm_source=instantly&mtm_kwd=emailx1) and experience the benefits for yourself.
